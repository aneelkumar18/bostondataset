        "\n",
        "**1. Descriptive Statistics:**  \n",
        "**Mean:** The average values of the features and the target variable are calculated, providing an overall sense of the data.  \n",
        "**Median:** The middle value in the dataset for each feature, which helps understand the central tendency and compare it with the mean.  \n",
        "**Mode:**The most frequently occurring value in the dataset for each feature.  \n",
        "**Standard Deviation:** Indicates the amount of variation or dispersion of each feature from its mean.     \n",
        "**Variance:** The squared standard deviation, showing the spread of the feature values.  \n",
        "**Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values, giving insight into the range of values.   \n",
        "**Skewness:** Measures the asymmetry of the distribution of values. Positive skewness indicates a long tail on the right, while negative skewness indicates a long tail on the left.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. One-Sample T-Test for Average Number of Rooms (RM):**  \n",
        "**T-Statistic:** Measures how many standard deviations the sample mean is from the hypothesized population mean (6.0 in this case).  \n",
        "**P-Value:** Indicates the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one computed, under the null hypothesis. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the observed mean is significantly different from the hypothesized mean.  \n",
        "**Conclusion:** If the p-value is low, it means that the average number of rooms in the dataset is significantly different from the hypothesized population mean of 6.0. If the p-value is high, the average number of rooms is not significantly different from the hypothesized mean.  \n",
        "**3. 95% Confidence Interval for Average Number of Rooms (RM):**  \n",
        "Provides a range within which the true population mean of the average number of rooms is expected to lie with 95% confidence. If the hypothesized mean of 6.0 falls outside this interval, it indicates that it is unlikely that the true population mean is 6.0.\n",
        "**4. Linear Regression Analysis:**  \n",
        "**Model Summary:** The linear regression model is fitted to predict housing prices (target) based on the average number of rooms (RM). The model summary includes:  \n",
        "**Coefficients:** Show the relationship between the predictor (average number of rooms) and the target variable (housing price). A positive coefficient suggests that an increase in the number of rooms is associated with an increase in housing price.  \n",
        "**R-squared:** Represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the predictor variable. Higher values indicate a better fit of the model to the data.  \n",
        "**P-Value:** Tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero (no effect). A low p-value indicates that the predictor variable is significantly associated with the target variable.  \n",
        "**Confidence Intervals:** Provide a range within which the true coefficient values are expected to lie with a certain level of confidence."

        "Descriptive statistics offer insights into the distribution and spread of the dataset.  One-sample t-test helps determine whether the average number of rooms differs significantly from a hypothesized value.  95% confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true mean of the average number of rooms.Linear regression demonstrates the relationship between the number of rooms and housing prices, helping to understand how changes in the number of rooms impact housing prices.  The model summary provides valuable statistics to interpret the significance and strength of this relationship. Overall, this analysis helps in understanding the data, validating assumptions about the average number of rooms, and modeling the relationship between the number of rooms and housing prices."
