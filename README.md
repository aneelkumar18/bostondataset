# INFORMATION ABOUT BOSTON HOUSING DATASET

The Boston Housing Dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It was originally published in a 1978 paper by Harrison and Rubinfeld and is used extensively for regression tasks and model evaluation. Here's a brief overview:

# Overview :
Source: Originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and commonly used in educational materials.
It is often referenced in the sklearn.datasets module under load_boston(), but it has been deprecated in recent versions due to ethical concerns and data privacy issues.
Purpose: The dataset contains information about housing values in the Boston area and is used to predict housing prices based on various features.

# Dataset Features :
The dataset includes the following features:
CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.
ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population.

# Target Variable :
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

# Dataset Size :
Number of Instances: 506

Number of Features: 13 (excluding the target variable)

# Usage :
The Boston Housing Dataset is frequently used for:
Regression Analysis: Predicting the median value of homes based on the features.
Model Evaluation: Testing and comparing different regression models and techniques.
Educational Purposes: Teaching regression analysis, data preprocessing, and statistical modeling.
# Ethical Considerations
Data Privacy: There have been concerns about the ethical implications and data privacy, leading to the dataset being deprecated from the latest versions of libraries like sklearn.
